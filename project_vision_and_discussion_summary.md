# Project Vision and Discussion Summary

## Vision
- **Target Audience**: Game developers from indie to triple-A studios.
- **Goal**: Create a highly accurate predictive model for evaluating game development difficulty.
- **Initial Feature**: Rating and ranking system allowing users to compare their project with similar games.
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Assessments to help users plan resources (budget, team size, duration).
  - Predict unknown variables based on known inputs.
- **Ultimate Goal**: Build a large database of rated and ranked games for public use.

## Key Points

### Data Collection
- **Approach**: Manual input with AI assistance to evaluate games using a comprehensive rubric.
- **Goal**: Ensure high accuracy and consistency in ratings.

### Predictive Models
- **Metrics**: Evaluate all factors involved in game development (technical, project management, marketing, creative, support).
- **Validation**: Use algorithms to update and improve models with more data.

### Advanced Features
- **Initial Parameters**: Budget, team size, project duration.
- **Accuracy**: Ensure predictions are reliable through continuous validation.

## Questions and Considerations

1. **Feedback Mechanism**:
   - Initial testing by the developer.
   - Plan for beta testing in the future to gather feedback.

2. **Data Security and Privacy**:
   - Basic IP protection plan.
   - Proper licensing and security measures before release.

3. **User Experience**:
   - Plan to develop an intuitive and efficient UI.

4. **Collaboration with Game Developers**:
   - Potential future partnerships with industry experts.

## Next Steps
1. **Finalize the Rubric**: Ensure it covers all necessary aspects of game development.
2. **Implement Basic Algorithms**: Start with simple models for dynamic weighting and genre detection.
3. **Develop a Basic UI**: Create a prototype for data input and result display.

## Rubric Example (Initial Factors)
- **Technical**: Graphics Quality, Animation Quality, AI Behavior, etc.
- **Project Management**: Team Size, Development Time, Budget, etc.
- **Marketing and Business**: Marketing Strategy, Community Engagement, Sales, etc.
- **Creative and Artistic**: Art Style, Story and Narrative, Character Design, etc.
- **Support and Maintenance**: Post-Launch Support, Modding Support, Customer Support, etc.

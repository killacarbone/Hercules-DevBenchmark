Project Introduction: Hercules DevBenchmark
Project Overview
Hercules DevBenchmark is a software project aimed at game developers, ranging from indie developers to triple-A studios. The primary objective is to provide a highly accurate and predictive model to evaluate the complexity and difficulty of game development projects. The software will utilize a comprehensive rubric system to rate and rank games, providing valuable insights and assessments for developers.

Goals
Comprehensive Evaluation: Develop a detailed rubric system to evaluate various aspects of game development, including graphics, storyline, user interface, innovation, and more.
Granularity of Scale: Implement a 10-level evaluation system to capture nuanced details and ensure objective and reliable assessments.
Predictive Models: Utilize predictive models to provide developers with insights into development difficulty, required resources, budget, team size, and project duration.
Database of Rated Games: Build a large database of rated and ranked games to serve as a reference for developers.
User Interaction: Allow users to input known variables to predict unknown variables, facilitating better planning and resource allocation.
Current Status
We have completed Phase 4: Testing and Debugging, and are ready to proceed with Phase 5: Implementation of Detailed Rubric and Scale.

Next Steps
Develop the Rubric: Create detailed evaluation rubrics for each factor, spanning all 10 levels. Each factor should have clear, detailed descriptions and numerical benchmarks for each level.
Granularity of Scale: Ensure the rubric system is comprehensive and detailed enough to handle the complexity and nuances of game development evaluation.
Data Collection: Gather and input data into the system to build the initial database of rated and ranked games.
Algorithm Improvement: Refine the normalization and dynamic weighting algorithms to enhance the predictive accuracy of the software.
User Feedback Integration: Develop mechanisms to incorporate user feedback to continuously improve the evaluation system.
Immediate Task
The immediate task is to develop a detailed rubric for each factor, ensuring it spans all 10 levels with clear and consistent criteria. The focus should be on maintaining a high level of detail and accuracy to ensure reliable assessments.

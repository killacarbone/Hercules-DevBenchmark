let me present you with my vision, i encourage you to ask me questions so we can better brainstorm

my vision is to create a software that will target game developers from indi games to triple A studios.

i would like my software to be highly accurate with predictive models. 

the initial feature of the rating and ranking would allow the user to refer to a game that is similar to their project to gain accurate perspective on the difficulty they will experience with the development of this game. this will be the initial interaction for a user. My goal is to work with ai to fully build a database of rated and ranked games for this to be as accurate as possible.

furthermore, i would like the software to have advanced features, such as assessments. The goal for assessments would be to help the user plan and formulate a plan for developing their game. by this i don't mean lay out their game project plan, but i mean to evaluate resources that will be required to achieve their goal. this resource may include, but aren't limited to budget, team size, duration needed to complete the project.

expanding on the last part, i would like the software to contain a feature that would allow them to input variables that they have answers to, in order to accurately predict a variable that they don't have answers to. an example of this would be, if the user knows the team size they're working with, the duration they have to complete the project, and the scale of the project they would be able to accurately predict what the required budget would be for this project.

the goal for my project is less of a program where you can provide an input for a game and return a rating. the goal is for me to input mass amounts of data/evaluations for a large database of games, for this to then provide value to the public user.

does my vision make sense to you? again, i would love for you to respond with questions to help me brainstorm and expand the project.

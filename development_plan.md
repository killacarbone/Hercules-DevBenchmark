## 1. Initial Setup and Structure

**Goal:** Establish a solid project structure and initial codebase.

- **Project Structure:**
  - `game-rating-system/`
    - `data/`
      - `predefined_ratings.json`
      - `ratings.txt`
    - `src/`
      - `__init__.py`
      - `main.py`
      - `code_generator.py`
      - `rating_calculator.py`
      - `file_operations.py`
      - `game_rating_ui.py`
    - `tests/`
      - `__init__.py`
      - `test_code_generator.py`
      - `test_rating_calculator.py`
      - `test_file_operations.py`
    - `instructions.md`
    - `requirements.txt`
    - `README.md`

- **Initial Codebase:**
  - Basic functionality for inputting game data and calculating complexity ratings.
  - Ensure the existing features (e.g., parsing input code, calculating ratings) are working correctly.

## 2. Normalization and Dynamic Weighting Features

**Goal:** Implement features that allow the system to adapt and balance scores dynamically.

- **Normalization of Ratings:**
  - Normalize ratings to a common scale (e.g., 0-100).
  - Ensure normalization occurs both when new games are added and periodically.

- **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**
  - Adjust the importance of each factor based on trends in the data.
  - Implement algorithms to increase or decrease factor weights based on their significance across many games.

- **Re-calculate Scores:**
  - Re-calculate complexity scores for all games whenever a new game is added.
  - Ensure scores remain balanced and meaningful.

## 3. Implementation of Detailed Rubric and Scale

**Goal:** Develop a comprehensive rubric and expand the rating scale to provide more precise evaluations.

- **Expansion of Scale:**
  - Increase the rating scale from 0-1,000 to 0-10,000.

- **Comprehensive Rubric Development:**
  - Develop detailed criteria for each factor (e.g., graphics, AI, scripting).
  - Ensure each criterion has a specific range (0-10,000) to support nuanced evaluations.

## 4. Monitoring and Reporting System

**Goal:** Implement a system to monitor learning progress and generate reports.

- **Learning Reports:**
  - Generate periodic reports summarizing data trends and potential adjustments.
  - Highlight key insights, such as consistently high or low factors.

- **Periodic Normalization:**
  - Schedule regular normalization updates to ensure scores reflect the latest data.
  - Implement background processes for periodic checks and adjustments.

## 5. User Interface Enhancements

**Goal:** Improve the user interface to provide a more interactive and informative experience.

- **Interactive UI for Ratings:**
  - Create an interface for users to input game data and receive ratings.
  - Ensure the UI is user-friendly and intuitive.

- **Historical Data Visualization:**
  - Implement features to visualize historical data and trends.
  - Provide charts or graphs showing the evolution of ratings over time.

## 6. Assessment Feature Implementation

**Goal:** Develop an interactive assessment feature to provide detailed development plans and cost estimates.

- **Development Assessment:**
  - Create an assessment tool to evaluate the development requirements of a game.
  - Include factors like budget, team size, scope of development, and expected revenue.

- **Interactive Development Planning Tool:**
  - Allow users to input their budget, team size, and scope of development.
  - Provide detailed development plans, including estimated time, cost, and resources required.

## 7. Presentation of Crucial Game Information

**Goal:** Enhance the presentation of ratings by including crucial game information.

- **Genre:**
  - Categorize the game by genre (e.g., RPG, FPS, Strategy).
  
- **Developer:**
  - Include the name of the development studio or individual.
  
- **Development Cost:**
  - Provide an estimate of the development cost.
  
- **Additional Relevant Factors:**
  - Include other factors such as release date, target platforms, and more.

## 8. Testing and Troubleshooting

**Goal:** Ensure the system is robust and free of major bugs.

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Write unit tests for all functions and modules.
  - Ensure each component works correctly in isolation.

- **Integration Testing:**
  - Test the interaction between different components.
  - Ensure the system works as a whole.

- **Performance Testing:**
  - Test the system's performance under various loads.
  - Ensure it remains responsive and accurate with large datasets.

## 9. Documentation and Instructions

**Goal:** Provide comprehensive documentation and instructions for users and developers.

- **Comprehensive User Guide:**
  - Create a user-friendly guide explaining how to use the system.
  - Include step-by-step instructions and examples.

- **Development Documentation:**
  - Document the codebase and development process.
  - Ensure developers understand how to extend and maintain the system.

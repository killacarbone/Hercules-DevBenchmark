# Creating a Comprehensive Game Development Evaluation Rubric

## Introduction

The goal of this rubric system is to provide a comprehensive, detailed, and consistent method for evaluating various aspects of game development. Each criterion within the rubric is broken down into 10 levels, ranging from 0 to 1000, to capture the full spectrum of quality and performance. This system uses specific numerical benchmarks and detailed descriptions to ensure objective and reliable assessments.

## Methodology

### Overview

1. **Criteria Selection**: Identify the key criteria that need to be evaluated.
2. **Define Levels**: Each criterion is divided into 10 levels, from 0-1000.
3. **Numerical Benchmarks**: Establish specific numerical benchmarks for each level.
4. **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions for each sub-level within the primary levels.

### Steps for Creating the Rubric

#### Step 1: Identify the Criteria

1. **Categories**: Break down the criteria into categories such as Technical, Project Management, Marketing and Business, Creative and Artistic, and Support and Maintenance.
2. **Factors**: List specific factors within each category (e.g., Graphics Quality, Animation Quality, etc.).

#### Step 2: Define Levels

1. **Primary Levels**: Divide each criterion into 10 primary levels (0-100, 101-200, etc.).
2. **Sub-Levels**: Further divide each primary level into sub-levels (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, etc.).

#### Step 3: Establish Numerical Benchmarks

1. **Specific Metrics**: Identify specific metrics relevant to each factor (e.g., frame rate, resolution, number of crashes).
2. **Benchmarks**: Set numerical benchmarks for each sub-level within the primary levels.

#### Step 4: Provide Detailed Descriptions

1. **Clear Descriptions**: Write clear and detailed descriptions for each sub-level.
2. **Examples**: Provide examples where applicable to illustrate what each level looks like.

## 0-100
- **0-10:**
  - **Joint Movement:** No ragdoll physics, joints remain rigid upon impact (0 flexibility).
  - **Body Reaction:** Characters fall stiffly without any joint flexibility (0 joint movements).
  - **Interaction with Environment:** No response to environmental forces (0 interactions).
  - **Realism:** Completely unrealistic, with characters behaving like static objects (0 realism).

- **11-20:**
  - **Joint Movement:** Very basic ragdoll physics, joints have minimal movement (1-2 joint movements).
  - **Body Reaction:** Limited flexibility, with noticeable stiffness (1-2 points of flexibility).
  - **Interaction with Environment:** Basic response to environmental forces, but highly unrealistic (1-2 interactions).
  - **Realism:** Very low realism, with exaggerated and unnatural behaviors (1-2 realism points).

- **21-30:**
  - **Joint Movement:** Limited ragdoll physics with noticeable glitches (3-4 joint movements).
  - **Body Reaction:** Slightly improved flexibility, but still mostly stiff (3-4 points of flexibility).
  - **Interaction with Environment:** Limited response to environmental forces, some noticeable issues (3-4 interactions).
  - **Realism:** Slightly better realism, but still not natural (3-4 realism points).

- **31-40:**
  - **Joint Movement:** Slightly improved physics, still lacks realism (5-6 joint movements).
  - **Body Reaction:** Movements are stiff and not very responsive to forces (5-6 points of flexibility).
  - **Interaction with Environment:** Basic interactions with environment, still unrealistic (5-6 interactions).
  - **Realism:** Improved realism, but still with noticeable errors (5-6 realism points).

- **41-50:**
  - **Joint Movement:** Basic functional ragdoll physics with occasional unnatural behaviors (7-8 joint movements).
  - **Body Reaction:** Movements are slightly more natural, but still rigid (7-8 points of flexibility).
  - **Interaction with Environment:** More stable interactions with the environment, but still lacking (7-8 interactions).
  - **Realism:** Generally acceptable realism with minor glitches (7-8 realism points).

- **51-60:**
  - **Joint Movement:** More stable ragdoll physics, but lacks smooth transitions (9-10 joint movements).
  - **Body Reaction:** Movements are smoother, but still not fully natural (9-10 points of flexibility).
  - **Interaction with Environment:** Better integration with the environment, but still not perfect (9-10 interactions).
  - **Realism:** Improved realism with occasional errors (9-10 realism points).

## 101-200
- **101-110:**
  - **Joint Movement:** Basic ragdoll physics with improved joint movement (19-20 joint movements).
  - **Body Reaction:** Movements are slightly more responsive to forces (19-20 points of flexibility).
  - **Interaction with Environment:** Basic interaction with environment forces, still unrealistic (19-20 interactions).
  - **Realism:** Low realism, with movements still looking unnatural (19-20 realism points).

- **111-120:**
  - **Joint Movement:** Slightly more responsive to different types of forces (21-22 joint movements).
  - **Body Reaction:** Improved flexibility in joint movements (21-22 points of flexibility).
  - **Interaction with Environment:** Better handling of environmental interactions (21-22 interactions).
  - **Realism:** Low to moderate realism, still has some noticeable issues (21-22 realism points).

- **121-130:**
  - **Joint Movement:** Improved joint constraints leading to more believable movements (23-24 joint movements).
  - **Body Reaction:** Movements are more natural and responsive (23-24 points of flexibility).
